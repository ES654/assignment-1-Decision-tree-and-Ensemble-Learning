        Figure 1 consists of 1 row and `n_estimators` columns
        The title of each of the estimator should be associated alpha (similar to slide#38 of course lecture on ensemble learning)
        Further, the scatter plot should have the marker size corresponnding to the weight of each point.

        Figure 2 should also create a decision surface by combining the individual estimators
